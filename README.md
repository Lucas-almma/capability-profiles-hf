## Reproducing Capability Profile Figures

This repository provides a fully reproducible pipeline for generating **capability profile radar plots** for large language models using publicly available benchmark data from the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.

---

### Data Source

All quantitative scores are retrieved directly from the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard backend API:

```
https://open-llm-leaderboard-open-llm-leaderboard.hf.space/api/leaderboard/formatted
```

This endpoint is the same data source used by the official leaderboard UI and returns structured, machine‑readable benchmark results for all evaluated open‑weight models.

---

### Capability Mapping (HF‑Native)

Capability dimensions are mapped exclusively to benchmarks that are **explicitly available** in the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.

| Capability | HF Benchmark |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reasoning | BIG‑Bench Hard (BBH) |
| Problem‑Solving | MATH |
| Learning / Generalization | MMLU‑PRO |
| Judgment | GPQA |
| Instruction Following | IFEval |

Capabilities such as **Attention** and **Memory** are explicitly noted as *not directly measured* by the HuggingFace leaderboard and are therefore excluded from quantitative plots.

---

### Normalization

HuggingFace benchmark scores are provided as normalized values on an approximate 0–100 scale.  
For visualization consistency, all scores are linearly rescaled to a 0–5 range using:

```
score_0_to_5 = hf_normalized_score / 20
```

This transformation preserves relative performance differences and is applied uniformly across all benchmarks.

---

### Figure Generation

Capability profile figures are generated using the notebook:

```
notebooks/generate_radar_plots.ipynb
```

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. Fetches benchmark data from the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard API  
2. Applies the HF‑native capability mapping  
3. Linearly rescales benchmark scores to a 0–5 range  
4. Writes processed data to:
   ```
   data/processed/hf_normalized_scores.csv
   ```
5. Generates one radar plot per model in:
   ```
   figures/capability_profiles/
   ```

All figures included in the paper can be regenerated by re‑running this notebook. No manual data manipulation or score adjustment is performed.

---

### Reproducibility Notes

- The data ingestion step is fully automated and pulls directly from the leaderboard backend.
- All transformations are explicitly defined and documented.
- Full plots for all evaluated models are available in the repository; figures shown in the paper may reflect a curated subset for clarity.
